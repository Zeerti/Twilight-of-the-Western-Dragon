                Welcome to the Ryūjin Era (Dragon God Era), year 157, in the
                sacred realm of Ryūjingoku - the Empire of the Dragon God. Our
                tale unfolds in the prosperous city of Kaigenrō (Rising Dawn
                Pavilion), the new capital of the Eastern Dragon Clan. For
                decades, our people have been locked in bitter conflict with
                Kurokura (Black Storage), the fortress-city of the Western
                Dragon Clan. Once unified under the divine rule of the Dragon
                Emperor, Ryūjingoku now stands divided, its ancient traditions
                and powerful magics threatened by civil war.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  You find yourself in Kaigenrō, a city of 50,000 souls, where
                  ancient traditions blend with desperate innovation. As exiles
                  who arrived during the great upheaval three years ago, you've
                  carved out a place among its winding streets and bustling
                  markets. The war that drove you here still rages, but the high
                  walls and strategic location of Kaigenrō have kept its people
                  safe—for now.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  The conflict began when the last Dragon Emperor, supreme ruler
                  of Ryūjingoku, died without naming a successor. His twin sons,
                  Lord Akashi of the East and Lord Kuroshi of the West, both
                  claimed the Celestial Throne. Their rivalry split the empire,
                  with each brother claiming to be the true inheritor of the
                  Dragon's Mandate and rightful ruler of all Ryūjingoku.

                  harmony. They hold the ancient Dragon Scrolls and claim
                  legitimate succession through their interpretation of imperial
                  law.
