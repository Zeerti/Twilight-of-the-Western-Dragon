                  Before the great divide, Li Lung and Chiang Lung were more
                  than mere guardians of their respective domains - they were
                  partners in maintaining the natural harmony of the realm.
                  Where Li Lung nurtured the ancient forests, Chiang Lung's
                  rivers brought their vitality to the furthest reaches of the
                  empire. Their combined power created a land of unprecedented
                  prosperity and balance.

                    When the imperial brothers turned against each other, the
                    dragons too found themselves at odds. The schism between the
                    once-harmonious dragons manifested physically in the land
                    itself - where once stood mere rocky hills, their
                    conflicting powers thrust upward the mighty Kuniwari Range,
                    a physical embodiment of the divide that now plagues the

                      more powerful and unpredictable, carving new paths through
                      the Muromori Woods. The waters now flow with an intensity

                    very earth remembers the pain of their creation.

                  Welcome to the Ryūjin Era (Dragon God Era), year 157, in the
                  sacred realm of Ryūjingoku - the Empire of the Dragon God. Our
                  tale unfolds in the prosperous city of Kaigenrō (Rising Dawn
                  Pavilion), the new capital of the Eastern Dragon Clan. For
                  decades, our people have been locked in bitter conflict with
                  Kurokura (Black Storage), the fortress-city of the Western
                  Dragon Clan. Once unified under the divine rule of the Dragon
                  Emperor, Ryūjingoku now stands divided, its ancient traditions
                  and powerful magics threatened by civil war.

                  <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    You find yourself in Kaigenrō, a city of 50,000 souls, where
                    ancient traditions blend with desperate innovation. As
                    exiles who arrived during the great upheaval three years
                    ago, you've carved out a place among its winding streets and
                    bustling markets. The war that drove you here still rages,
                    but the high walls and strategic location of Kaigenrō have
                    kept its people safe—for now.

                  <p className="leading-relaxed">
                    The conflict began when the last Dragon Emperor, supreme
                    ruler of Ryūjingoku, died without naming a successor. His
                    twin sons, Lord Akashi of the East and Lord Kuroshi of the
                    West, both claimed the Celestial Throne. Their rivalry split
                    the empire, with each brother claiming to be the true
                    inheritor of the Dragon's Mandate and rightful ruler of all
                    Ryūjingoku.
